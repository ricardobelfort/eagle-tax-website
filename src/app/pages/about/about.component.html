        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <h3>Our Journey</h3>
        <p>
          Founded in 1993 by Paulo Oliveira and his wife Priscilla in Coconut
          Creek, Florida, Eagle Tax began as a small home office with a handful
          of clients. With Paulo’s background as a CPA in Brazil and Priscilla’s
          expertise in accounting and linguistics, they quickly established a
          reputation for excellence in tax preparation and accounting services.
          Their commitment to the Brazilian community and beyond allowed them to
          grow significantly, serving over 2,500 clients across the U.S. and
          various countries, including Argentina, Colombia, Canada, and
          Portugal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, Eagle Tax has expanded its offerings to include a
          comprehensive range of solutions such as international and expatriate
          tax services, IRS dispute resolution, bookkeeping, payroll, and more.
          Their dedication to quality and community service made them a trusted
          name in the industry.
        </p>

        <h3>A New Chapter</h3>
        <p>
          In 2021, after nearly three decades of successful service, Paulo and
          Priscilla decided to retire. Seeking a successor who could uphold
          their legacy and further enhance the company’s offerings, they found
          the ideal candidate in Alvin Hommerding. With extensive experience as
          a CPA and a strong background in auditing and financial management,
          Alvin took over Eagle Tax in October 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under Alvin’s leadership, the firm has embraced new technologies and
          innovative practices, ensuring that our team is well-equipped to meet
          the evolving needs of our clients. With a commitment to maintaining
          the high standards set by Paulo and Priscilla, we have strengthened
          our team and expanded our capabilities.
        </p>

          by addressing their most challenging financial concerns. Our solutions
          portfolio includes tax return preparation, international and
          expatriate tax services, IRS dispute resolution, bookkeeping, payroll,

          corporation management.

          transparency, and a client-centric approach. Our goal is to foster

          dedicated to providing unparalleled service and expertise, helping our
          clients navigate their financial journeys with confidence.
